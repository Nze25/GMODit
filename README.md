# GMODit
Minecraft launcher using legacy code for Mojang's deprecated Login API.

Requires Visual Studio 2012 or newer.

To use, download zip and extract into your Visual Studio Projects folder into a folder named `GMODit`. Open `GMODit.sln` in Visual Studio and wait for it to finish loading the solution. Rebuild the project, and run without debugging to test.

To run the launcher without using Visual Studio, copy the `GMODit.exe` and `Interop.Shell32.dll` from the `GMODit\bin\Debug` folder and place them where you would like to run them from.

You may modify this code for yourself in any way provided you give me credit for the original work.
